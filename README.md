# Soundboard

Soundboard is a website for playing instruments. It allows users to make beats with 8 different type of instruments. The use case used to produce this project was `I want to be able to create beats online`.

## How to install
First clone this repo with:
```txt
$ git clone https://github.com/eltongonc/browser-technology.git
```

then start a localhost server. I use PHP
```txt
$ npm start && npm run live
```
this should give you live ngrok server for testing purpose

## Fallback process
1. JS enhancement. JavaScript allows users to use the keyboard and mouse to interact. And adds classes to the html file
```js
window.addEventListener("keydown", function(event){
    var id = event.key.toUpperCase();
    if (event.code !== "Space" && document.getElementById(id)) {
        var src = document.getElementById(id);
        var newAudio = new Audio( src.children[1].src);
        newAudio.play();
        src.parentNode.classList.add("active");
    }
});
window.addEventListener("keyup", function(event){
    var id = event.key.toUpperCase();
    if (event.code !== "Space" && document.getElementById(id)) {
        var src = document.getElementById(id);
        src.parentNode.classList.remove("active");
    }
});
```
2. Audio feature. This is the ideal fallback. The user can play the audio file
```html
<audio preload="auto" id="Q"  controls>
    <!-- If the browser supports .wav -->
    <source src="/sounds/Claps/Claps09.wav" type="audio/wav">
    <!-- If the browser supports .mp3 -->
    <source src="/sounds/Claps/Claps09.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>
```
3. IE enhancement. This is a internet explorer only feature and will show an player. Clicking on the play button allows the user to listen in the browser
```html
<embed controls="true" autostart="false" src="/sounds/Claps/Claps09.wav" />
```
4. No support. The user can download and listen to the file offline if the browser doesn't support audio.
```html
<a href="/sounds/Claps/Claps09.wav">Download</a>
```
